North
====================
**Align and Guide Your Project**

North is a set of standards and best practices for developing modern web based properties. Included are standards and best practices for all aspects of a project, from kick off through development. North encourages an agile, content-first, approach to product development and a mobile-first, in-browser, system based approach to design and development.

North is meant to be a living document. Standards and best practices change, and as they do and have been vetted, North will grow and change with them. North will be versioned using [SEMVER](http://semver.org/) to provide a way for you to specify what version of North you are using for your project.

## CSS

### Naming Conventions

Selectors, mixins, variables, and placeholder selectors should all share a similar naming convention.

The following items need to be represented uniquely, with the numbers representing how often they will (probably) be used.

```table
_______________________________
|           | Phase | Element |  
------------------------------|
| Component |   2   |    1    |
------------------------------|
| Layout    |   4   |    3    |
-------------------------------
```

States should be handled through data attributes. 

Requirements for naming convention: Something easy to write, easy to visually distinguish hierarchy, easy to distinguish nesting.

[Various naming conventions under consideration](http://sassmeister.com/gist/7428308).

### Sass+Compass

When writing CSS, use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) with the [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) authoring framework. When compiling Sass and Compass, only use the Ruby gems to compile them or a tool that calls out to the Ruby gems. The `scss` syntax should be used exclusively when writing and sharing Sass. In order to ensure that all environments are the same, the minimum version of Ruby that should be used is `2.0.0` (standard on OS X version 10.9 and up) and all gems should be installed and versions managed by [Bundler](http://bundler.io/). When writing a [Gemfile](http://bundler.io/v1.5/gemfile.html), versions should all be specified using the `~>` specifier to ensure that gems stay on the same major and minor versions, making upgrades in minor versions purposeful. Gems can either be installed in to either the ruby system or in to a folder in your project named `vendor` which should be ignored from your version control. In addition to Bundler, there are a number of Compass extensions that should be used as a standard for a variety of needs.

* [Singularity](https://github.com/Team-Sass/Singularity) - Grid framework
* [Breakpoint](https://github.com/Team-Sass/breakpoint) - Media query framework
* [Toolkit](https://github.com/team-sass/toolkit) - Variety of useful tools for web design and development
* [Jacket](https://github.com/Team-Sass/jacket) - Tool for deciding what gets printed in a given stylesheet
* [Color Schemer](https://github.com/Team-Sass/color-schemer) - Advanced color functions
* [Modular Scale](https://github.com/Team-Sass/modular-scale) - Numeric relationships, especially for typography

The following should be using the standard [Compass configuration](http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/configuration-reference/) for all projects:

```ruby
# Set this to the root of your project when deployed:
http_path = "/"
css_dir = "css"
sass_dir = "sass"
images_dir = "images"
javascripts_dir = "js"
fonts_dir = "fonts"

# You can select your preferred output style here (can be overridden via the command line):
# output_style = :compressed

# To enable relative paths to assets via compass helper functions. Uncomment:
relative_assets = true

# To disable debugging comments that display the original location of your selectors. Uncomment:
line_comments = false
```


### Mixin/Extend Pattern

Mixins are best used when they don't needlessly duplicate the properties they write. We can do this using placeholder selectors and `@extend`. The only properties that should be erectly written to the selector calling a mixin should be properties that have been directly altered due to mixin arguments. Any other properties should be extended. All arguments that have default values should have those default values controlled by globally namespaced `!default` variables to make overriding those defaults easy and accessible. All mixins that provide extends should also have an `$extend` optional argument, ideally as its last argument, also globally defaulted.

Mixins should also be divided up by purpose. While an omni mixin may be easier to write, having smaller mixins will make maintaining and using your mixins, as well as changing discrete parts of a rendered component, easier to do.

Let's take a look at a typical message component mixin as an example of how to re-write it using our mixin/extend pattern.

```scss
// Sass
@mixin message($color, $padding: .25em .5em, $width: 80%) {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: $padding;

  width: $width;
  margin: 0 auto;

  border: 2px solid $color;
  background: mix(white, $color, 25%);
  color: mix(black, $color, 25%);
}

.message-status {
    @include message(green);
}

.message-warning {
    @include message(yellow);
}

.message-error {
    @include message(red);
}
```

```css
/* CSS */
.message-status {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: .25em .5em;
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  border: 2px solid green;
  background: #3f9f3f;
  color: #006000;
}

.message-warning {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: .25em .5em;
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  border: 2px solid yellow;
  background: #ffff3f;
  color: #bfbf00;
}

.message-error {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: .25em .5em;
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  border: 2px solid red;
  background: #ff3f3f;
  color: #bf0000;
}
```

While the single mixin may allow us to easily get the output we want, it does so at the cost of duplicating properties, and thus vastly bloating, our output CSS. This can be remedied almost entirely simply by rewriting our original mixin using our new mixin/extend pattern.

```scss
// Sass
$message-padding: .25em .5em !default;
$message-width: 80% !default;
$message-extend: true !default;

@mixin message-core($padding: $message-padding, $width: $message-width, $extend: $message-extend) {
  // If we're not extending ($extend == false), we write properties directly
  @if not $extend {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    padding: $padding;
    
    width: $width;
    margin: 0 auto;
    
    // Border's color is based off of the `color` property, so we can write valid shorthand without the color. Border options aren't dynamic to clearly show a succinctly show this short hand method.
    border: 2px solid;
  }
  @else {
    // If we are extending ($extend == true), we extend the placeholder selector
    @extend %message-core;
    // If $padding is different than our default padding, we write that property
    @if $padding != $message-padding {
        padding: $padding;
    }
    // If $width is different than our default width, we write that property
    @if $width != $message-width {
      width: $width;
    }
  }
}

@mixin message-coloring($color) {
  border-color: $color;
  background: mix(white, $color, 25%);
  color: mix(black, $color, 25%);
}

%message-core {
  // We include the message-core mixin with $extend == false to force the properties to be written
  @include message-core($extend: false);
}

.message-status {
  @include message-core;
  @include message-coloring(green);
}

.message-warning {
  @include message-core;
  @include message-coloring(yellow);
}

.message-error {
  @include message-core;
  @include message-coloring(red);
}
```

```css
/* CSS */
.message-status, .message-warning, .message-error {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 0.25em 0.5em;
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  border: 2px solid;
}

.message-status {
  border-color: green;
  background: #3f9f3f;
  color: #006000;
}

.message-warning {
  border-color: yellow;
  background: #ffff3f;
  color: #bfbf00;
}

.message-error {
  border-color: red;
  background: #ff3f3f;
  color: #bf0000;
}
```

While this approach certainly requires more work up front to build the mixins and extendables, it produces much more controlled and succinct output CSS, which is what we're aiming to write. 

### Sass Structure

Sass partials are a way for us to organize our styling knowledge into maintainable and easily grokable chunks. An example Sass partial structure is available in the folder `sass`.

At the root of our Sass folder is our `style.scss` file, which holds the core of our styling, and a `no-script.scss` file to provide a CSS fallback if scripting isn't available. In the `sass` folder, create an `enhancements` folder a `fallbacks` folder, and a `partials` folder for your stylesheets that provide enhanced styling for powerful browsers, fallback styling less powerful browsers, and partials for all to draw from, each respectively.

Each feature you're enhancing with or providing a fallback for should be named `feature.scss` and be placed into their respective folder; for instance if you were to provide enhancements and fallback for CSS Animations, you would have a folder structure that looked something like `sass/enhancements/css-animations.scss` and `sass/fallbacks/css-animations.scss`.

The `partials` directory should be divided up into 3 sub directories, `global`, `components`, and `layouts`. Inside of `global`, you should have a  folder a piece for `variables`, `functions`, `mixins`, and `extendables`, with partials to match. Inside each of those folders should go partials whose content should be made available globally and aren't component specific. For instance, global color and typographic variables, background/text color contrast mixins, ligature extendables, etc… 

Both your components and your layouts should be built using a similar partial structure, henceforth known as the component partial structure. Each component should have a partial and matching folder, and inside that folder a partial a piece for `variables`, `functions`, `mixins`, and `extendables`. Each of these partials should hold styling knowledge specific to that component; for instance, `variables` could have color variables specific to that component, but the color it is set to should come from the global color partial. An example of this can be seen in in the example `sass` folder.

All extendable classes should be wrapped in a solution to only have the selector written once. to ensure that selectors don't get needlessly duplicated. Mixins should share their naming convention with the object they are used to style.

### Component Styling

Components should be written to be able to be dropped in to any position in a layout. The way to accomplish this is to build components using [**eq.js**](https://github.com/snugug/eq.js).
